# Energy Difference and Error Analysis Tools

This folder contains Python scripts for calculating energy differences between crystal polymorphs, averaging energy data for single crystals, and computing error metrics from simulation outputs. It also includes comprehensive energy reporting utilities.

Contains scripts for:
- Calculating energy differences for combined or single crystal datasets.
- Computing statistical averages of energy differences.
- Calculating and reporting various error values related to energy computations.
- Generating detailed energy reports summarizing calculated results and metrics.

These tools enable rigorous analysis of energy data and error estimation critical for validating computational chemistry and materials science simulations.

## Usage

Run the scripts to perform energy difference calculations, average energies across polymorphs or crystals, and compute error statistics. Use the reporting scripts to generate summary outputs highlighting key energetic properties and errors.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (if used for plotting in some scripts)
- Other libraries as specified within individual scripts
