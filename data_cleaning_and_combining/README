# Conversion and Visualization Tools

This folder includes utilities for data format conversion and visualization related to molecular and crystal datasets.

Contains scripts for:
- Converting crystal Refcodes to SMILES strings and 3D molecular XYZ files.
- Generating PNG images from refcodes for visual reference.
- Visual comparison of descriptor distributions through histograms and bar charts.
- Validation and visualization notebooks for SMILES from new molecules.

These tools support data exploration, validation, and help bridge cheminformatics file formats.

## Usage

Run conversion scripts to translate between crystal IDs, SMILES, and structure files. Visualization scripts create comparative plots of descriptor distributions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- rdkit
- CCDC Python API
