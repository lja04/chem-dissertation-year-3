# Visualization and Statistical Analysis Tools

This folder includes scripts and utilities to generate detailed graphical representations and perform statistical analysis on energy differences, timing measurements, and error metrics in computational chemistry and materials science datasets.

Contains scripts for:
- Generating plots of energy differences across single and combined crystal datasets.
- Creating visualizations for error values and statistics using histograms, overlapping plots, and subplots.
- Producing graphs for timing data such as average time per k-point or per k-value.
- Compiling multiple datasets into combined plots for comprehensive visual analysis.
- Visualizing statistical errors and comparing differences across data subsets.

These tools aid researchers in interpreting, validating, and presenting simulation results through clear, publication-quality figures.

## Usage

Run visualization scripts after preparing data with processing tools to create plots summarizing energy, timing, and error data. These visual outputs support data validation and result communication.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn (if required by specific scripts)
- Additional plotting libraries as specified within individual scripts
