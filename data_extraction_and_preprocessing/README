# Data Processing and Analysis Tools

This folder contains a collection of Python scripts designed for data processing, organization, timing analysis, and energy calculations related to computational experiments with crystals and molecules.

Contains scripts for:
- Filtering and analyzing energy data from simulation outputs.
- Collecting and organizing k-point numbers and timing data.
- Calculating total elapsed times and averaging timing data.
- Generating large CSV files from raw timing and energy data.
- Combining and cleaning energy values from multiple output files.
- Organizing files in directory structures and creating comprehensive datasets.
- Calculating and analyzing the number of k-points used in simulations.
- Computing advanced timing averages for detailed analysis of computational steps.

These tools facilitate systematic data collection, conversion, and statistical analysis essential for research workflows involving molecular and crystal datasets.

## Usage

Run each script to perform specific tasks such as filtering energy data, organizing timing and k-point data, or generating summary CSV files. Many of these scripts are designed to process multiple files within directory structures, enabling automated, large-scale data handling.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- re
- os
- shutil
- pathlib
- numpy (if used in scripts)
- Any other libraries specified within individual scripts as needed.
